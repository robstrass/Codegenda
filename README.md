# Codegenda
Codegenda is a web application modeled after Remember The Milk. Codegenda is geared towards programmers and software engineers as a way to store current info on projects(lists) and add tasks to those projects that they are working on. It is written with a combination of vanilla Javascript for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and PUG for the rendered pages.
